/**
 * Mitosis is a part of the cell cycle in which chromosomes in a cell nucleus are 
 * separated into two identical sets of chromosomes, and each set ends up in its 
 * own nucleus. In general, mitosis is often accompanied or followed by cytokinesis,
 * which divides the cytoplasm, organelles and cell membrane into two new cells 
 * containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components. Mitosis and 
 * cytokinesis together define the mitotic phase of an animal cell cycleâ€”the 
 * division of the mother cell into two daughter cells, genetically identical 
 * to each other and to their parent cell.
