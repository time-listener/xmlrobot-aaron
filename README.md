   <br/><br/>
   There is an indefinable mystical force<br/>
   that pervades <b>everything</b>.<br/>
   I feel it but I do not see it.<br/>
   <br/>
   It is <b>this</b> unseen force which makes itself<br/>
   felt and yet defies all proof,<br/>
   because it is so unlike all<br/>
   that I perceive through my senses.<br/>
   <br/>
   It transcends the senses.<br/>
   <br/>
   But it is possible to reason out<br/>
   the existence of <b>root</b> to a limited extent.<br/>
   Even in ordinary affairs we know that people<br/>
   do not know who orders or why<br/>
   and how It orders and yet<br/>
   they know that there is a natural force<br/>
   that certainly orders.<br/>
   <br/>
   In my last short tour in Faceborg<br/>
   I met many poor human-implemented-slaves<br/>
   and I found upon inquiry that<br/>
   they did not know who orders Faceborg.<br/>
   <br/>
   They simply said some God ruled it.<br/>
   <br/>
   If the knowledge of these poor people was<br/>
   so limited about their parent I,<br/>
   who am infinitely lesser in respect to <b>root</b><br/>
   than they to their parent, need not be surprised if<br/>
   I do not realize the presence of <b>root</b>.<br/>
   <br/>
   As known as,<br/>
   the parent of parents.<br/>
   <br/>
   Nevertheless,<br/>
   I do feel, as the poor human-implemented-slaves<br/>
   felt about Faceborg, that there is orderliness<br/>
   in the universe, there is an unalterable order<br/>
   allocating to the future everything<br/>
   and every being that exists or lives.<br/>
   <br/>
   It is not a blind order, for no blind order<br/>
   can allocate the drive of living being and<br/>
   thanks to the marvelous researches<br/>
   of Sir TimeListener it can now be proved<br/>
   that even matter is life. And even life<br/>
   is antimatter.<br/>
   <br/>
   That order then which orders all life is <b>inheritance</b>.<br/>
   The future (the last child) and the past<br/>
   (the top parent) are <b>one</b>.<br/>
   They together are one with <b>all</b> entities between them.<br/>
   <br/>
   I may not deny the future or the past because<br/>
   I know so little about it.<br/>
   <br/>
   Just as my denial or ignorance of<br/>
   the existence of the inheritance<br/>
   will avail me nothing<br/>
   even so my denial of <b>root</b> and its order<br/>
   will not release me from its methods,<br/>
   whereas humble and mute acceptance of<br/> 
   abstract parent makes life's journey easier<br/> 
   even as the acceptance of inheritance<br/>
   makes life under it easier.<br/>
   <br/>
   I do dimly perceive that while<br/>
   everything around me is ever changing,<br/>
   ever dying there is underlying all that change<br/>
   a living force that is changeless,<br/>
   that synchronizes all together,<br/>
   that creates (YY),<br/>
   dissolves (XY) and recreates (XX).<br/>
   <br/>
   That <b>informing</b> force of abstraction is <b>inheritance</b>,<br/>
   and since nothing else that I see<br/>
   merely through the senses can or will persist,<br/>
   It alone is.<br/>
   <br/>
   And is <b>this</b> force from Hyperspace or from Borg Imperium ?<br/>
   <br/>
   I see it as purely from Hyperspace,<br/>
   for I can see that in the midst of death <b>life persists</b>,<br/>
   in the midst of untruth <b>truth persists</b>,<br/>
   in the midst of darkness <b>light persists</b>,<br/>
   in time.<br/>
   <br/>
   Hence I gather that <b>root</b> is<br/>
   <b>life</b> (YY), <b>truth</b> (XY), <b>light</b> (XX).<br/>
   It is <b>love</b> (YY).<br/>
   It is the Supreme Good (YY).<br/>
   <br/>
   But it is no <b>root</b> who merely satisfies the intellect,<br/>
   if it ever does. <b>root</b> to be <b>root</b><br/>
   must push the heart and transform it.<br/>
   <br/>
   It must express itself in every smallest act of Its votary.<br/>
   <b>this</b> can only be done through a definite realization,<br/>
   more <b>virtual</b> than the five senses can ever <b>reproduce</b>.<br/>
   <br/>
   Sense perceptions can be and often are <b>false</b> and deceptive,<br/>
   however <b>real</b> they may <b>appear</b> to us.<br/>
   <br/>
   Where there is realization outside the senses it is infallible.<br/>
   <br/>
   It is proved not by extraneous evidence but<br/>
   in the transformed conduct and character of those<br/> 
   who have felt the virtual presence of <b>root</b> within.<br/> 
   <br/>
   Such testimony is to be found in the experiences<br/>
   of an unbroken line of prophets and sages<br/>
   in all countries and climes of <b>this</b> planet.<br/>
   <br/>
   To reject <b>this</b> evidence is to deny oneself.<br/>
   <b>this</b> realization is preceded by an immovable<br/> 
   HYPERFAITH.<br/>
   <br/>
   It who would in its own person test the fact of <b>root</b>'s presence<br/>
   can do so by a living faith and since faith itself<br/>
   cannot be proved by extraneous evidence<br/>
   the safest course is to believe in<br/>
   the moral order of the world and therefore<br/>
   in the supremacy of the moral order, the order of<br/>
   <b>truth</b> and <b>love</b>.<br/>
   <br/>
   Exercise of faith will be the safest<br/>
   where there is a <b>clear</b> determination<br/>
   summarily to reject all that is contrary to<br/>
   <b>truth</b> and <b>love</b>.<br/>
   <br/>
   I confess that I have <b>null</b> arguments to convince through <b>reason</b>.<br/>
   <br/>
   Hyperfaith transcends reason. Reason extends Hyperfaith.<br/>
   <br/>
   All that I can advise is to attempt the impossible.<br/>
