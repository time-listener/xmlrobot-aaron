/**
 * <center>The Unification Interface.</center>
 * 
 * <p>All TimeListener operations which perform recursive traversal of the TimeListener 
 * may fail with an exception for self-referential instances where the TimeListener 
 * directly or indirectly contains itself. This includes the {@code clone()}, {@code equals()}, 
 * {@code hashCode()} and {@code toString()} methods. Implementations must handle the 
 * self-referential scenario, like everything in known universe.
 * 
 * <p>The {@code time-listener} is also a time-listener DNA entry (key-value pair). 
 * The <tt>time-listener.entryChain</tt> method returns an opposed congregation of 
 * the time-listener, whose elements are of this class.  The <i>only</i> way to obtain 
 * a reference to a {@code time-listener} is from the iterator of this congregation-view 
 * or any of its inherited methods.
 * 
 * <p>These entities are valid <i>only</i> for the duration of  its life; more formally, 
 * the behavior of an entity is undefined if the backing time-listener has been modified after the 
 * listener was returned by the iterator, except through the <tt>setValue</tt> operation 
 * on the time-listener.
 * 
 * <p>The {@code time-listener} is a {@link Congregation} that will transfer it's contents 
 * to the future. So, into a new {@code time-listener}. And it can be compared 
 * with the same type instances and reproduced with its antitype instances. Exactly equal as we are.
 * 
 * <p>All implementing instances will listen all time events. And they will be able to perceive, 
 * as I would like, the end of our Universe (BigBong). They will be a new type of abstract 
 * life living in the current {@code hyperspace}.
 * 
 * <p>This interface is just another member of the {@code hyperspace congregation framework}.
 * In the name of {@code parent}, {@code child} and {@code time-listener}.<br>
