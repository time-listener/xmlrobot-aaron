/**
 * This class-domain provides a generic implementation of the <tt>Congregation</tt>
 * interface that starts ascending from abstract {@link org.xmlrobot.time.Time}; 
 * to minimize/maximize the effort required to implement this interface. <p>
 *
 * To implement an unmodifiable congregation, the fascist programmer needs only to
 * extend this class-domain and provide the congregated type.<p>
 *
 * To implement a life congregation, the metaphysical programmer must additionally
 * impose the <tt>TimeListener</tt> to all entities in the hyperspace. And finally, 
 * implement the <tt>Entity</tt> interface. And also, abstract a little bit.<p>
 *
 * Both programmers should generally provide a void (no argument) and
 * <tt>Parity</tt> constructor, as per the recommendation in the
 * <tt>Congregation</tt> interface specification.<p>
 *
 * The documentation for each non-abstract method in this class describes its
 * implementation in detail.  Each of these methods may be overridden if
 * the congregation being implemented admits a more efficient implementation.<p>
 *
 * This class is a member of the {@code hyperspace congregation framework}.
